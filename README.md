# Material-UQ

This repository provides the basic source code of the manuscript "A data-driven uncertainty quantification framework in probabilistic bio-inspired porous materials (Material-UQ): An investigation for RotTMPS plate structures," with the following features:
- An effective strategy is presented to handle incomplete data on material properties.
- The BNN-pSGLD model uses a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) with preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (pSGLD) for data-driven uncertainty quantification (UQ).
- *Material-UQ*: A data-driven framework for probabilistic structural behavior prediction with material property uncertainty.
- Material-UQ's prediction of RotTPMS plate behavior is validated using real-world metal material data sourced from MatWeb.
- The probability distribution of uncertainty in structures' mechanical responses to aid designers in fine-tuning design parameters and achieving performance expectations is visualized.
